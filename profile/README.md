- 🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved? You can upload on repl.it and tests the repositys
- 👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
- 🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast? Uhmm... Ehm... Milk!
- 🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) Yes yes, i'm remember this!
